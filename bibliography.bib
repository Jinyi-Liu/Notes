	abstract = {This chapter reviews the supply chain coordination with contracts. Numerous supply chain models are discussed. In each model, the supply chain optimal actions are identified. The chapter extends the newsvendor model by allowing the retailer to choose the retail price in addition to the stocking quantity. Coordination is more complex in this setting because the incentives provided to align one action might cause distortions with the other action. The newsvendor model is also extended by allowing the retailer to exert costly effort to increase demand. Coordination is challenging because the retailer's effort is noncontractible—that is, the firms cannot write contracts based on the effort chosen. The chapter also discusses an infinite horizon stochastic demand model in which the retailer receives replenishments from a supplier after a constant lead time. Coordination requires that the retailer chooses a large basestock level.},

We develop a mild restriction satisfied by many common distributions that assures that the manufacturer's problem is readily amenable to analysis. The manufacturer's profit and sales quantity increase with market size, but the resulting wholesale price depends on how the market grows. For the cases we consider, we identify relative variability (i.e., the coefficient of variation) as key: As relative variability decreases, the retailer's price sensitivity decreases, the wholesale price increases, the decentralized system becomes more efficient (i.e., captures a greater share of potential profit), and the manufacturer's share of realized profit increases. Decreasing relative variability, however, may leave the retailer severely disadvantaged as the higher wholesale price reduces his profitability. We explore factors that may lead the manufacturer to set a wholesale price below that which would maximize her profit, concentrating on retailer participation in forecasting and retailer power. As these and other considerations can result in a wholesale price below what we initially suggest, our base model represents a worst-case analysis of supply-chain performance.},

	abstract = {While every firm in a supply chain bears supply risk (the cost of insufficient supply), some firms may, even with wholesale price contracts, completely avoid inventory risk (the cost of unsold inventory). With a push contract there is a single wholesale price and the retailer, by ordering his entire supply before the selling season, bears all of the supply chain's inventory risk. A pull contract also has a single wholesale price, but the supplier bears the supply chain's inventory risk because only the supplier holds inventory while the retailer replenishes as needed during the season. An advance-purchase discount has two wholesale prices: a discounted price for inventory purchased before the season, and a regular price for replenishments during the selling season. Advance-purchase discounts allow for intermediate allocations of inventory risk: The retailer bears the risk on inventory ordered before the season while the supplier bears the risk on any production in excess of that amount. This research studies how the allocation of inventory risk (via these three types of wholesale price contracts) impacts supply chain efficiency (the ratio of the supply chain's profit to its maximum profit). The efficiency of a single wholesale price contract is considerably higher than previously thought as long as firms consider both push and pull contracts.},

To reconcile manufacturing/procurement time lags with a need for timely response to the market, such supply chains often must commit resources to production quantities based on forecasted rather than realized demand. The customer typically provides a planning forecast of its intended purchase, which does not entail commitment. Benefiting from overproduction while not bearing the immediate costs, the customer has incentive to initially overforecast before eventually purchasing a lesser quantity. The supplier must in turn anticipate such behavior in its production quantity decision. This individually rational behavior results in an inefficient supply chain. The incentives of the 2 parties are modeled, identifying the causes of inefficiency and suggesting remedies.},

	abstract = {In the electronics industry and others, original equipment manufacturers ({OEMs}) are selling their production facilities to contract manufacturers ({CMs}). The {CMs} achieve high capacity utilization through pooling (supplying many different {OEMs}). Meanwhile, the {OEMs} focus on innovation: research and development, product design, and marketing. We examine how this change in industry structure affects investment in innovation and capacity, and thus profitability. In particular, innovation is noncontractible, so {OEMs} will invest less in innovation than is ideal for the industry as a whole. Hence, although contract manufacturing improves capacity utilization, it may reduce the profitability of the industry as a whole by weakening the incentives for innovation. Contract manufacturing is not the only means to achieve capacity pooling. Alternatively, the {OEMs} can pool capacity with one another through supply contracts or a joint venture. This may result in underinvestment or overinvestment in innovation and capacity, but always increases profitability. We find that the sale of production facilities to a {CM} improves profitability for the industry as a whole if and only if {OEMs} are subsequently in a strong bargaining position vis-à-vis the {CM}. If the {OEMs} are indeed very strong, the gain from pooling capacity via contract manufacturing is maximized in industries with moderate cost of capacity.},

	title = {Inducing Forecast Revelation through Restricted Returns},
	abstract = {We consider a supply chain consisting of one supplier selling through one retailer who faces a newsvendor problem. There is a positive probability that the retailer is capable of gaining improved demand information through costly forecasting. The supplier would like to induce the retailer to forecast and share that information. Restricting the retailer’s ability to return unsold product would intuitively appear to be a viable way by which to provide the desired incentives. However, it is well known that a generous returns policy increases the supplier’s profit. We explore this tension between providing incentives to forecast and capturing channel profits. We examine both price-based returns mechanisms  (buy backs) and quantity-based returns mechanisms (quantity flexibility contracts). Thus, a second goal is to compare the relative performance of these two schemes.We show that under either contract, inducing forecasting retailers to take a different contract from non-forecasting retailers requires restricting returns. The forecaster is charged a lower price than the non-forecaster but has less flexibility in returning product. Using buy backs, the supplier must sacrifice some channel profit to differentiate between forecasting and non-forecasting retailers. With quantity flexibility contracts, reducing channel efficiency is not required to distinguish between the types of retailers. It is consequently some what surprising that buy backs generally result in greater supplier profit than quantity flexibility contracts unless forecasting is very expensive.},

The manufacturer and subcontractor decide separately on their capacity investment levels. Then demand uncertainty is resolved and both parties have the option to subcontract when deciding on their production and sales. Outsourcing conditions are analyzed and presented for three contract types: 1. price-only contracts where an ex-ante transfer price is set for each unit supplied by the subcontractor; 2. incomplete contracts, where both parties negotiate over the subcontracting transfer, and 3. state-dependent price-only and incomplete contracts for which an equivalence result is shown. While subcontracting with these three contract types can coordinate production decisions in the supply system, only state-dependent contracts can eliminate all decentralization costs and coordinate capacity investment decisions. The minimally sufficient price-only contract that coordinates our supply chain specifies transfer prices for a small number of contingent scenarios. The game-theoretic model allows the analysis of the role of transfer prices and of the bargaining power of buyer and supplier.},

A hierarchical model is developed, and the results of the single period inventory model are used to examine possible pricing and return policies. The paper shows that several such policies currently in effect are suboptimal. These include those where the manufacturer offers retailers full credit for all unsold goods or where no returns of unsold goods are permitted. The paper also demonstrates that a policy whereby a manufacturer offers retailers full credit for a partial return of goods may achieve channel coordination, but that the optimal return allowance will be a function of retailer demand. Therefore, such a policy cannot be optimal in a multi-retailer environment. It is proven, however, that a pricing and return policy in which a manufacturer offers retailers a partial credit for all unsold goods can achieve channel coordination in a multi-retailer environment.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a risk-neutral manufacturer sells a single product to a risk-neutral retailer. The retailer chooses inventories ex ante and promotional effort ex post. If the wholesale price exceeds marginal production cost, the retailer orders fewer than the joint profit-maximizing inventories. If the manufacturer attempts to coordinate inventories by buying back unsold units, then the retailer's promotional incentives are dulled. Under very general assumptions on the form of the effort function, we show that buy-backs adversely affect supply chain profits, and higher buy-back prices imply lower profits. Also, while a buy-back alone cannot coordinate the channel, coupling buy-backs with promotional cost-sharing agreements (if effort cost is observable), offering unilateral markdown allowances ex post (if demand is observable but not verifiable), or placing additional constraints on the buy-back (if demand is observable and verifiable) does result in coordination. This problem is not limited to returns policies but is shown to hold for a much larger set of contracts. The results are quite robust (e.g., when the retailer chooses effort before observing demand), but coordinating contracts become more problematic if, for example, the retailer also stocks substitutes for the manufacturer's product. Other model extensions are also discussed. [{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},
