\section{Coordination with multiple newsvendors}
This section considers two models with one supplier and multiple competing retailers. 

\subsection{Competing newsvendors with a fixed retail price}
Set $c_r=g_r=g_s=v=0$, increase the number of reatilers to $n>1$. $D$ the total retail demand. And for each retailer $i$'s demand:
\begin{equation*}
    D_i=\left(\frac{q_i}{q}\right)D,
\end{equation*}
where $q=\sum_i=1^n q_i$ and $q_{-i}=q-q_i$.
